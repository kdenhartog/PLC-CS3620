Project Title: Implement XML parser in a different language

Project Members: Myself

Summary:
For my final project I intend to create an implementation of the XML parser we
created in HW7, but this time it will be written in F#. This will follow the
same guidelines as the Agda version and will have the same functionality.

Technology:
I plan to use Antlr as a parsing generator and F# to write my XML grammar file.
To remediate potential issues with Visual Studio, I plan to work on this using
the lab computers which are Windows based machines.

Milestone: I intend to have the beginning layout of my input.xml file complete
and will have begun working on the XML grammar file.

Backup plan:
In the even that I encounter issues installing/working with Visual Studio to
write my files, I will look to write my files in a different language.
The current order of languages I would use would be F# (plan A), Haskell,
OCaml, then elisp. I have chosen to consider these as a backup language because
I believe I may encounter issues trying to work in visual studio using Mac.
