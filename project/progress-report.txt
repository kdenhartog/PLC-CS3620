I have completed the setup of my development environment using F#. I have chosen to use atom as my text editor and used "brew install mono" to be able to compile through the command line. brew is a package installer setup for Mac
environments I am currently working to get Fparsec setup in my environment as well. I have also downloaded the FParsec Library, which is a library used to parse grammar files in F#. It is similar to the parsec library built for Haskell.
This library should be able work with my development environment. The issue I have found so far is that they are officially provided as .dll files which could prove problematic. I plan to spend a little more time trying to setup the
libraries on my mac, and if I am unable to I will attempt to use FsLexYacc which is another LExer and parser generator for F#. I have read that FsLexYacc doesn't work as well as FParsec which is why I opted to use FParsec first. It
appears that both of these projects can be built using mono, but I have yet to find a working solution.
