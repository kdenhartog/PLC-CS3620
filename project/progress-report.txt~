I have completed the setup of my development environment using F#. I have chosen to use atom as my text editor and used "brew install mono" to be able to compile through the command line. brew is a package installer setup for Mac	     environments I am currently working to get Fparsec setup in my environment as well. I have also downloaded the FParsec Library, which is a library used to parse grammar files in F#. It is similar to the parsec library built for Haskell. This library should be able work with my development environment. The issue I have found so far is that they are officially provided as .dll files which could prove problematic. I plan to spend a little more time trying to setup the libraries on my mac, and if I am unable to I will remote into the CS lab to resolve this issue.
